      "Message": "feat: Rebuild as Anthra Security platform for FedRAMP engagement\n\nTransformed from training app to realistic GuidePoint client application.\n\nMajor changes:\n- Renamed NovaSec \u2192 Anthra Security Inc.\n- Removed deliberately vulnerable code (SQLi, XSS, command injection)\n- Kept realistic security gaps (MD5, no auth, secrets in env vars)\n- Removed GP-Copilot overlay (policies now in GP-CONSULTING/07-FedRAMP-Ready)\n- Removed DVWA target-app directory\n- Updated all branding and documentation\n- Added company profile and engagement context\n- Rewritten API (api/main.py) with CWE markers\n- Rewritten log-ingest service (services/main.go)\n- Updated K8s manifests (infrastructure/) with TODO markers\n- Updated docker-compose.yml with Anthra branding\n\nApplication now represents a realistic startup that needs GuidePoint's\nFedRAMP expertise, not a deliberately insecure training target.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>",
